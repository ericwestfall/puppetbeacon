"""Monitoring library for Puppet Agent and Puppet Server components.

Implements a number of interfaces for interacting with Puppet Agent state and
provides the ability to reliably determine the status of a Puppet Agent,
profile catalog run performance and detect failed resources and events.

Also provides interfaces for interacting with Puppet Server service APIs to
reliably detect the status of critical services on Puppet.

Attributes:
    LOG (:class:`logging.Logger`): A module level logger instance. The
        configuration of handlers is the prerogative of developers consuming
        the library.
